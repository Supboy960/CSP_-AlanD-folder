            <p>This is a place I have spent one week of my summer almost every year. The place is just beautiful. The sand is nice, and it has fancy bathrooms for when you need to go. No large monster-sized mosquito on one side of the wall. And the night is a bit of my favorite time because we make a big bonfire and make s'mores.</p>

            <p>If you found this, it shows that there are diffrent places at Bear Lake that people might enjoy. And hopefully you CAN GET THERE EARLY BECAUSE IT GETS FULL DURING THE SUMMER. Hope you made reservations 5 months early. It's a good place in my opinion, but that's for you to find out. If you do or don't like this amazing place. Well, these images will show you places I will someday camp at. (Not in an RV but REAL camping.) </p>

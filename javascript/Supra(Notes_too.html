        <p>Supras are good and for this reason there are hidden thngs that will shows why you like Supras. They are a relable car, they will keep kicking with or without its engine. If you seen the Challenger thing, you know if it makes a turn at 60 miles an hour you need to hold on to your life. JDM cars are the cars that have benn perfected. And if you keep reading I will show you some tircks.</p>

        <h3>Toyota Mark IV Supra</h3>
<ul>
    <li>276–320 HP, 3.0L Inline-6 Twin Turbo</li>
    <li>0–60 mph in ~4.6 seconds</li>
    <li>Top speed ~155 mph (Limited)</li>
    <li>Top speed 175–185 mph (without limiter)</li>
    <li>~324 lb-ft torque (unchanged with limiter removed)</li>
    <li>Removing the limiter allows the Supra to achieve higher top speeds, but acceleration and torque remain the same unless further engine modifications are made. (Hey this is for the optimal conditions, The Redeye is  a big baby)</li>
</ul>

<p>Look Toyota has been a relable car company for many years. If you don't believe me then your loss. If you are still reding then thank you for beliveing me. JDM cars are maily good, just not as good as toyota. But they are still good my second choice is honda. Cheper to modfy and make faster. But if you are a tuner then get a Supra and if you move you mouse on top of the title then you might see someone that also agrees with JDM being the top car for tuners. </p>

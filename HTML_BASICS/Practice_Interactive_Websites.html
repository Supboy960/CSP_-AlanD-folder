                   <h3> This car that with live in supercars and not juckyard like the doge challer</h3>

                   <p>This will be about the past and future verions of this legand of a car. We won't be talking about the Mk5 becasue that is just a BMW. Which doesn't live up to the name. But how Toyota had to go many satly reltion and then stopp makeing the Mk2-3. Then is looks like with MK4 Toyota didn't get much salty reagultion/ reason to sottp the produion, but when tuners (people that like JDM's and modified them) got their handsa on this they knew how much more caplbe then it really was. Then engian could compt wagsit a frrieri and give it a run for its money. This legared of a car was too good, as it coulb out monwer, out run, and undeacble by the police foces in Japan that they got angry at toyota for making this beast of a car</p>

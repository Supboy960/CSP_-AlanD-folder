        <h1 id="title">The Legendary Mk4 Supra vs Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Jailbreak</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Paragraph -->
        <p>Douglas and I have been talking about our dream cars recently, which made me think: Whose car is really better? In this website, I will be comparing the two cars to explain why the Mk4 Toyota Supra is better than the 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Jailbreak. Not only does the Supra deliver unmatched tuning potential, but heads turn and jaws drop at its sleek, timeless design—a symbol of automotive history and pure performance. Meanwhile, the Hellcat, with all its flashy horsepower, is just another gas-guzzler that screams “try-hard” as it guzzles fuel and struggles to fit in parking spaces. People see a Hellcat and think, “That guy wants attention,” but when they see a Supra, they nod with respect—it’s a car that commands admiration, not noise. The Mk4 Supra’s legendary status is unshakeable, proving itself as a car worthy of the dream garage.</p>

    <p>The Toyota Supra Mk4 Turbo is considered the best because it’s super powerful, easy to upgrade, and fun to drive. It has a famous engine called the 2JZ-GTE, which can handle tons of extra power, making it great for modifications. It’s also lightweight, which helps it race faster and handle turns better. People will always remember the Mk4 Supra as one of the greatest cars ever made!</p>

        <!-- Comparison Section -->
        <h2>Chargers VS Supras</h2>
<h3>The 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Jailbreak</h3>
<ul>
    <li>807 HP, 6.2L Supercharged V8</li>
    <li>0–60 mph in ~3.6 seconds</li>
    <li>Top speed ~203 mph (Limited)</li>
    <li>215–220+ mph in optimal conditions (without limiter. optimal conditions becasue it will sevre off the freeway.)</li>
    <li>707 lb-ft torque (unchanged with limiter removed)</li>
    <li>Removing the limiter reveals the car's true potential for top speed but doesn’t improve acceleration or torque. (This goes for both)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Toyota Mark IV Supra</h3>
<ul>
    <li>276–320 HP, 3.0L Inline-6 Twin Turbo</li>
    <li>0–60 mph in ~4.6 seconds</li>
    <li>Top speed ~155 mph (Limited)</li>
    <li>Top speed 175–185 mph (without limiter)</li>
    <li>~324 lb-ft torque (unchanged with limiter removed)</li>
    <li>Removing the limiter allows the Supra to achieve higher top speeds, but acceleration and torque remain the same unless further engine modifications are made. (Hey this is for the optimal conditions, The Redeye is  a big baby)</li>
</ul>


        <!-- Roast Section -->
        <h1>Flaws with the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye Jailbreak</h1>
        <h2>Big on Power, but Bigger on Bulk</h2>
        <p>The Dodge Charger Hellcat Redeye is like the heavyweight boxer who skipped leg day—a beast on the straights but hopelessly clumsy in the corners. Sure, it boasts 797–807 HP, but when that power is hauling around nearly 4,600 pounds of car, it’s like dragging a boulder uphill. Good luck feeling agile in a car that’s as wide as a cruise ship and handles more like one.</p>
       
        <h2>It's All Noise, No Respect</h2>
        <p>The Dodge Charger Hellcat Redeye Jailbreak? More like a gas-guzzling beast that’s crying for attention but lacks the finesse to back it up. Sure, it can tear up a drag strip, but let’s face it—it’s about as nimble as a refrigerator strapped to roller skates. Its bloated size and weight make it the heavyweight champion of clumsy driving. And don’t even get me started on its design—it’s basically a family sedan wearing a “fast car” Halloween costume. Who’s it trying to fool? A true enthusiast sees the Hellcat and thinks, “Ah, someone spent their savings to make a lot of noise and still get smoked by a properly tuned sports car.” It’s less of a legend and more of a loud, overly aggressive mascot that guzzles gas faster than it picks up speed.</p>
        
        <h2>Supercar Speeds, Sedan Looks</h2>
        <p>The Hellcat might be fast, but underneath all that speed is a basic four-door sedan trying to masquerade as something more remarkable. Let’s face it, it’s hard to take it seriously when it still looks like the car you’d borrow from your dad for prom night. The Supra? It’s sleek, stylish, and unmistakably built for enthusiasts—not soccer runs or carpooling.</p>

        <h2>Straight Roads Only, Please</h2>
        <p>While the Hellcat thrives on a drag strip, throw a couple of curves its way and you’ll find yourself gripping the wheel for dear life. Its size and weight make it a nightmare to maneuver compared to the Supra, which dances through turns like a ballerina. The Hellcat might win the stoplight showdown, but the Supra will leave it gasping in a real driving scenario.</p>

        <h2>Legacy? What Legacy?</h2>
        <p>The Mk4 Supra is the stuff of legend, cemented by its robust 2JZ-GTE engine, pop culture stardom, and cult following worldwide. The Hellcat? It’s got raw power, but let’s not pretend anyone’s putting its V8 up on a pedestal for groundbreaking innovation. Once the Charger is gone, it’ll fade into the background like just another muscle car—while the Supra remains an everlasting icon.</p>

        <h2>Fuel Guzzler Extraordinaire</h2>
        <p>At least you can save some cash modding a Supra instead of constantly fueling the Charger Hellcat. The Hellcat drinks gasoline like an all-you-can-eat buffet, while the Supra’s tuned setup can balance performance without needing to stop at every gas station along the highway.</p>

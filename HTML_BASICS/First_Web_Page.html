        <h3>2JZ-GTE</h3>
        <p>This is one of my favrotie engines. From what I know it is one of the most relidebe and powerful engines, inside a legender car The MK4 Supra. The engine is capleable of make 100 hp, this are can conpet against a frriri and keep up. This is one of many JDM (Japnesese Domestic Market) cars that I would like to own. (Also mabye a Doge and a Mclearn)<br>If you don't know what the supre is then, <strong>It is one of the best cars (That I can afford) in the world. It was featured in a very famuos movie like i don't know Fast and Fourious.</strong></p>
